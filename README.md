# Instructions
To add medication:
- Double click on the columns and type away
- Count column should be in current/total, for example 12/30
- A .txt fill will be created, called Prescriptions.txt Keep this file at the same folder as Preminder

Use everyday:
- Take removes one from the medication
- Add increases the repeat by 1 (you still need to manually set the counts back to full)
- If you set Preminder to run at startup, it will act to remind you to take your medication
- Closing the window saves automatically
